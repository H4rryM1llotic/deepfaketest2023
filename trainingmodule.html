                        <h2><b>What are Deepfakes?</b></h2>
                        <p class="mb-0">Have you ever seen an image or a video that just isn't quite right? Perhaps a celebrity doing something out of character?
                            <br />
                            <br />
                            <b>These are deepfakes.</b>
                            <br />
                            <br />
                            Deepfakes are the next cyber security epidemic. The term comes from combining the words, deep learning and fake. They are made from an area of artifical intelligence called deep learning. There are several main machine learning methods used to create deepfakes such as,
                            generative neural network architectures, such as autoencoders and generative adversarial networks (GANS).
                            <br />

                            <br />
                            <br />
                            Basically, they are extremely realistic images or videos of a person and can be used to maliciously to portray the person doing something they never did.
                            <br />
                            <br />
                            <h2><b>Why do I need to know this?</b></h2>
                            As technology is advancing at accelerated speeds, the way that cyber criminals can attack us is growing. Cyber criminals have become very sophisticated and with easy access to social media their attack rate has risen. 
                            <br />
                            <br />
                            Social media is a cyber criminal’s playground, coupled with easy access to image editing and apps that can warp people’s sense of reality, it does not take a highly skilled person with the highest quality specifications for a PC or laptop to create potentially damaging images or videos.
                            <br />
                            <br />
                            Cyber criminals will 100% use Deepfakes in the future to try and influence public opinion. How do we know this? <b><i>It has already happened.</i></b> When? During the war in Ukraine. Russian hackavists created a deepfake of President Zelenksy, telling his soldiers to lay down their arms and surrender.
                            <br />
                            <br />
                            I know what you’re thinking – but that’s to extreme. However, it was circulated on social media, so if you have social media or watch the news, you could become a victim.
                            <br />
                            <br>
                            <h2><b>How can I tell?</b></h2>
                            With that in mind, how can you tell what is real and what is a deepfake without having detective imagery in your back pocket. You can look for signs.
                            <br />
                            <br />
                            These include:
                            <br />
                            <ul>
                            <li>Unnatural eye movements – are they blinking?</li>
                            <li>Unusual skin tones, strange lighting, odd shadows on their face</li>
                            <li>Audio quality – does the voice sound robotic? Is the video out of sync?</li>
                            <li>Body shape and movement – does the image portray the correct body shape of the person? Are their movements choppy and lagging?</li>
                            <li>Facial features – Are their eyes in the correct place? Is their nose super large?</li>
                            </ul>
                            <br />

                            <br />
                            <br />
                            <h2><b>How can I stay safe?</b></h2>
                            <br />
                            Without the use social media automatically checking every picture or video to see if it’s real, you can stay safe by educating yourself and others on how to spot deepfakes, use good quality news sources and have a trust but verify attitude, this will not 100% guarantee you will be safe but it will help you from being susceptible.
